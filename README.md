# HighchartsMapsIntegration
HighChartsMaps integration into Wisej

A demonstration of the orthographic projection (3D globe) of highcharts maps, integrated into wisej

Wisej buttons and textboxes allow the user to change the title and color of the map, as well as the location. (Can click a button to jump to preset locations on the globe.) There is also a button that will make the globe constantly rotate, switching between preset locations.
The highcharts maps zoom in/out, rotate, and download files functionality is preserved.
